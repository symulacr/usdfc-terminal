# Claude Coding Guidelines

## Git Commit Messages

- **Always use lowercase for commit messages**
- **Keep commits concise and clear**
- Format: `fix: description` or `feat: description` or `chore: description`
- Examples:
  - `fix: resolve docker base image 404 error`
  - `feat: add api crate for wasm compatibility`
  - `chore: update dependencies`

## Code Style

- Follow Rust standard conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Avoid over-engineering - keep solutions simple

## Railway Deployments

- Test locally with `cargo leptos build` before pushing
- Monitor Railway builds via CLI
- Always verify endpoint functionality after deployment
